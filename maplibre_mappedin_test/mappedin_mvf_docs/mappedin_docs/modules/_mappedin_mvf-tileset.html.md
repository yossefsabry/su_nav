# MVF Tileset

The Tileset extension provides a way to define the outdoor tileset to use when rendering an MVF. It is largely use by the SDK, and will not typically be needed by a developer.

## Schema

The Tileset extension adds a single property to the root of the bundle, `tileset`, which is a [TilesetCollection](../types/_mappedin_mvf-tileset.index.TilesetCollection.html) object.
