# MVF Entrance Aesthetic

The Entrance Aesthetic extension describes aesthetic elements of doors, such as their swing direction and whether they are single or double doors.

This is purely for informational / rendering purposes, and does NOT impact wayfinding. For the direction doors can be walked through, see the [Connections](../modules/_mappedin_mvf-connections.html) and [Nodes](../modules/_mappedin_mvf-nodes.html) extensions.

The line string geometry an entrance aesthetic is associated with should be the entrance line string of the door Connection, if that extension is present.
